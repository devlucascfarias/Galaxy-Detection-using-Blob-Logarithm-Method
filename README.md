# Galaxy-Detection-using-Blob-Logarithm-Method

This code utilizes the Blob Logarithm method from the scikit-image library to detect galaxies in an image. The program presents a simple graphical user interface created with PySimpleGUI, allowing the user to select an image file for analysis. After loading the image, the code applies the Blob Logarithm algorithm to identify galaxies based on their characteristics. Detected galaxies are then visualized by overlaying circles on the original image. The resulting image with the detected galaxies is saved as "result.png" in the "log" directory. Additionally, the code displays the number of galaxies detected in a popup window. The necessary dependencies for the code include PySimpleGUI, scikit-image, and matplotlib. Make sure to install these dependencies using pip before running the code.
